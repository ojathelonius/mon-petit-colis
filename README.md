# La Poste Innovation Challenge - Mon petit colis

This is the code of the "Mon petit colis" prototype that was submitted as a part of the La Poste Innovation Challenge 2018. Due to the short timeline, only parts of the UI are linked to some logic, and no effort was put towards responsiveness or general web development guidelines.

"Mon petit colis" aims at providing businesses a way to customize, print and order packages to ship their products with style.
